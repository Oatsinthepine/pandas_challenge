# pandas_challenge
This is the repo for week4 pandas challenge.

For completing this challenge, as the request it's being written using jupyter notebook. So the methods used for this assignment includes use the pandas library to read csv files and loading them into dataframes. Also, combining the different dataframes forming into a complete frame for data cleansing, including using build in statistical method and df attributes. The usage of .loc to select the required data, as well as filtering, grouping using groupby, and ,cut with binning to transform all the dataframes into desired format for further analysing are used. 

So for this assignment, I used the original .ipynb file that are provided in the Starter_Code as the templet to finish all the other required questions, so there are some pre-written format and pre-provided answers which are left in the PyCitySchools_starter.ipynb as the week 4 challenge instruction given.
