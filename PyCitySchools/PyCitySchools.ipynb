    "So from the analysis below about the local schools and students. Firstly we can see that accorss all the schools, nom matter government or independent, the students within achieved a considerably remarkable pass rates for both reading and math. But the overall average reading score is not within a satisfactory level, which is only sitting in around 69%. This indicates an area for improvement in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, from the whole school summary, we can see that in the top 5 performing schools that 3 are independent and 2 are government. But the bottom 5 performed school there are 4 governments and only 1 independent. From the statistics, we can see that interestingly, the schools those received larger budgets did not yield more significance in grades that those who recieved less budgets. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, across all the data, it's hard to conclude the reason for this, as we can also see that the number of students in each school also affetcts the overall passing rate as well. As the tendenacy showed from the analysis that generally the school with fewer students and with average budget plus the per student budget yields better results.\n"
